## Scripts for Each Alternative

### Signing Bonus
"If the base salary is fixed, would a signing bonus help bridge the gap? Something like {AMOUNT} would make the overall package more competitive."

### PTO
"Work-life balance is important to me. If salary can't move, would adding 5 extra vacation days be possible?"

### Remote Work
"Flexibility is valuable to me. Would the team be open to a fully remote or hybrid arrangement?"

### Earlier Review
